# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic they do *not* have to
be completely connected. I have started with the formal definition of
isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

## My Response
Two graphs that meet the requirements do not have to be fully connected.
Let $A$ and $B$ both be graphs, and let them each contain only one node.  This means that they have no edges, and are completely disconnected.
Then let $f$ be a function that maps $A$ to $B$.
Then by the definition the function $f$ mapping $A$ onto $B$ is one to one, which satisfies the bijection requirement.
So by using the formal definition above we know then that both graphs are isomorphic even though they are not completely connected.
